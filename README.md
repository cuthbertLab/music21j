**Music21j: An Interactive Framework for Musical Analysis**

Copyright &copy;2013-21, Michael Scott Asato Cuthbert, some rights reserved (BSD).

**Music21j** is a Javascript reinterpretation of the [Music21 Python] package,
a toolkit for computer-aided musicology, now with intuitive HTML/Javascript
interfaces. Some things music21j offers are:

  - The ability to visualize and hear changes in Streams quickly (using [Vexflow] and [MIDI.js])
  - Connections (via Web Midi or [JazzSoft] plugin) to MIDI devices.
  - Music theory and analysis modules at the level of music21 ca. 2014
  - A repository of modules such as metronomes, keyboards, and automatic transcribers.

Though it does not have all the power of [Music21 Python], music21j can help with
a number of research problems in music history and theory. The introduction to the
Python package will say more about it (it's better documented). The "namespaces"
tab above will give introductions to some features of music21j. At this
point we're focusing on documenting usage; developer docs will come
later.

Music21j requires your users to have a relatively recent web browser -- the project
targets browsers no more than two years old.
Safari 9+, Chrome since 2015 (v.32+), Edge 14+, or Firefox since 2014 (v. 26+).  
Internet Explorer 11+ is currently supported, though timing of playback can be a bit off, but
support for it will be removed soon.  Microsoft Edge is the only major desktop browser for which
there is no support for MIDI devices.

Documentation
-------------
This README appears in both the GitHub home page and the documentation
home page; to make the following links work, go to the documentation
page at http://web.mit.edu/music21/music21j/doc/ .

Begin at the {@link music21} namespace (click the link or use the
menu above), or start with
a specific one such as {@link music21.note} or {@link music21.stream}
or a Class such as {@link music21.note.Note} or {@link music21.stream.Stream}.

(Ignore "Modules" they're not useful and duplicate the namespace pages).

Example
--------
Install by downloading a copy of the music21 code to your own webserver.

```sh
% npm install music21j
```


If this line (`npm install`) doesn't work, download the
latest version of `node.js` from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
  
A guide to installing music21j on Windows would be appreciated.

The files in music21j are best viewed by running your own
webserver (rather than using `file:///...` links). We've
included a small script to start you up:

```sh
$ cd ~/git/music21j
$ grunt webpack
$ python start_python_server.py
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8000/testHTML/ for some demos.

To use music21j in your own page, place in a html page like this (this assumes that you're
using the python server above).

```html
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title>music21 test</title>
</head>
<body>
   <script src="/node_modules/music21j/releases/music21.debug.js">
   </script>
   <script>
   const n = new music21.note.Note('F#');
   const s = new music21.stream.Stream();
   s.append(n);
   s.appendNewDOM();
   </script>
</body>
</html>
```

or use it in your own Javascript/Typescript project:

```sh
$ npm install --save music21j
```
```javascript
import * as music21 from 'music21j';

const n = new music21.note.Note('F#');
// etc.
```

Version
--------
0.13 beta


License

Music21j is released under the BSD 3-Clause License. Essentially you

Thanks
-----------

Thanks to the following packages (among others) for making music21j possible:

* [Vexflow] - music notation in HTML5
* [midicube] - audio processing of MIDI based on [MIDI.js]
* [Jazzsoft] - plug-in for accessing MIDI in the browser in the absence of WebMIDI Api.
* [jQuery] - easy manipulation of HTML DOM.
* [qUnit] - testing framework
* [jsdoc] - makes this documentation possible

The Python version of music21 was supported by grants from
the Seaver Institute and the National Endowment for the Humanities
and supported by the Music and Theater Arts section of [MIT].

Dev Notes
----------------
Build and watch with

```sh
$ grunt
```

test with

```sh
$ grunt test
```

You might get an error that looks like this which you can currently ignore:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 
'file:///soundfonts/midi-js-soundfonts-master/FluidR3_GM/acoustic_grand_piano-ogg.js' 
from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

We hope to fix it later, but for now, we're not testing audio output.


for running tests one time without watch, you can use:

```sh
$ grunt test_no_watch
```

Publishing a new version
-------------------------
You'll need to be part of the npm dev team.

Two steps.  First run:

```sh
$ grunt publish
```

which will update the version number and tries to build the
docs via `grunt jsdoc` (currently failing).

The template is specified in jsdoc-template/jsdoc.conf.json

For a non-backwards compatible release, edit the minor 
version number manually here, in main.ts, and of course in
package.json.

Then run:

```sh
$ npm publish
```

which will copy the current contents of `build` in `releases`
and publish on npm.

Before publishing, every once in a while run (in the music21j directory)

```sh
$ node_modules/.bin/npm-check-updates
```

and if it looks like something to update, run

```sh
$ node_modules/.bin/npm-check-updates -u
$ npm install
```


These docs will be changing in preparation for v. 1.0 release.
